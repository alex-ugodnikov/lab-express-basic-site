    <p>Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is an engineer, industrial designer, technology entrepreneur and philanthropist.[2][3][4][5] He is the founder, CEO, CTO and chief designer of SpaceX;[6] early investor,[7][note 1] CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.;[10][11] founder of The Boring Company;[12] co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI.[13] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[14][15] In December 2016, he was ranked 21st on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People,[16] and was ranked joint-first on the Forbes list of the Most Innovative Leaders of 2019.[17] As of July 24, 2020 his net worth was estimated at $65 billion and he is listed by Forbes as the 11th-richest person in the world. [18][19][1] He is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[20]

    Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa.[21] He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University.[21] He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School and a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences.[22] He moved to California in 1995 to begin a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University, but decided to pursue a business career instead of enrolling.[23] He co-founded (with his brother Kimbal) Zip2, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was subsequently bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.[10][24][25]
    
    In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.), an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded,[10] became its product architect, and became its CEO in October 2008.[26] In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel construction company focused on tunnels optimized for electric vehicles.
    
    In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop. Musk has said the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to "change the world and help humanity".[27] His goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption and lessening the risk of human extinction by establishing a human colony on Mars.[28][29][better source needed]</p>
